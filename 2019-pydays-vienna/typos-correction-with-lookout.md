**Abstract**:

Typos correction takes up a big part of code review process, which can and should be automated. We present Typos
Corrector - a tool for automatic correction of typos in code identifiers from pool requests. It is powered by AI and
source{d} Lookout - open source service for assisted code review,
that allows creating and running custom source code analyzers.
Typos Corrector encompasses the knowledge obtained from 60 million identifiers present in open source code. It adjusts
to the repository to take local conventions into account during checking. Typos Corrector achieves 93%
accuracy of corrections and has no analogues.
The talk will focus on the Typos Corrector architecture, details of its pure Python implementation and
problems which arise during applying ML in production of open source tools, which address real-world problems.

**Notes**:

This is my first talk and conference that I visit, so I desperately need guidence.
