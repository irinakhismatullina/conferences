# Building Video Games with Go

**Updates**:  https://github.com/src-d/conferences/issues/4
**Sent on**:  2018/01/12
**Status**:   accepted
**Author**:   Francesc Campoy
**Slides**:   TBA
**Proposal**: N/A

**Abstract**:

In this full day workshop we will build a game from scratch in Go and SDL.

Why Go? Because it's gophercon! But also because Go is great to model concurrent
worlds, so it's a great match to build video games.

We will use SDL to facilitate the game development, but the techniques that
we will learn can be easily applied to any other libraries you might be interested
on using.

We will also cover performance analysis, data race detection, distribution, and other
topics that while not completely linked to video games are essential to get our
game to eventual users.

**Notes**:

I was personally invited to give this workshop by one of the organizers.
