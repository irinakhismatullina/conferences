**Proposal**: N/A

**Abstract**:

source{d} is building the open-source components to enable large-scale code analysis and machine learning on source code.

Their powerful tools can ingest all of the worldâ€™s public git repositories turning code into ASTs ready for machine learning and other analyses, all exposed through a flexible and friendly API.

Francesc Campoy, VP of Developer Relations at source{d}, will show you how to run machine learning on source code with a series of live demos.

**Notes**:

I was invited personally by the organizers.
