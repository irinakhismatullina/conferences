**Abstract:**

Few people look at open source code as a massive dataset for researchers. Yet we've accumulated hundreds of terabytes of mostly human-generated data on GitHub which can be freely analyzed. Mining Software Repositories academic conference happens every year and presents extremely funny projects on top of open source. GHTorrent, Public Git Archive, TravisTorrent. Coding style transfer, code sentiment analysis, code modeling. This talk makes a very high-level overview of the conference's proceedings and also touches the related research we conduct at source{d}: github.com/src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code

**Notes:**

Type: talk 25 min
