**Abstract**:

Ensuring that a codebase is consistent in style is both hard and
costly, yet it is extremely important for maintainability and to
reduce technical debt. Why is it hard and costly? There are many
contributing factors but the main ones are certainly:

- teams might not have set up a linting process early enough or at
all
- people handling the codebase might be changing on a regular basis
- linters do not cover everything. Besides, they can be hard to set up
to their full power or can be too opinionated

This talk will introdue source{d}'s answer to that problem: a machine
learning based tool to automate style fixing, even in large legacy
code bases.
