**Abstract**:

Software development history, typically represented as a Version Control System log, is a rich source of insights into how the project evolved, as well as how its developers work. What's probably more important is events from the past can predict the future. This talk gives fun history mining examples and presents some of the available tooling. Some of the involved topics include embeddings, dynamic time warping, seriation, and HDBSCAN.

**Notes**:

Yet another Hercules talk.
