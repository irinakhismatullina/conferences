**Abstract:**

Machine Learning on Source Code (MLoSC) is an emerging and exciting domain of research which stands at the sweet spot between deep learning, natural language processing, social science, and programming. We've accumulated petabytes of source code data which is open, yet there have been few attempts to fully leverage the knowledge that is sealed inside. This talk should give an introduction to the current trends in MLoSC, present the tools and some of the applications, such as deep code suggestions and structural embeddings for fuzzy deduplication.
