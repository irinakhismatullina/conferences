# A deep dive into ML on Code

**Updates**:  #112

**Sent on**:  12/10/2018

**Status**:   proposed

**Author**:   Francesc

**Slides**:   TBD

**Proposal**:  https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ca/user/proposal/propose/cfp/690/74863

**Abstract**:

One-sentence description of your presentation:

> Machine Learning on Source Code will change the way we write code, but how does it really work? Let's deep dive into the ML techniques that will power the next generation of developer tooling.

Abstract:

> Machine Learning has revolutionized many fields, from cancer detection to self-driving cars, not forgetting about connected toilets that allow Alexa to flush at your command.
> 
> Researchers have been working on applying Machine Learning to source code to predict bugs, find patterns in code, and much more. At source{d}, we're building products applying this research to improve day-to-day developer tasks.
> 
> This talk will cover some of the techniques used, mention the most relevant research, but especially concentrate on use cases where Machine Learning can help developers be more efficient. We'll get into a deep discussion on what kind of model architectures and data transformations allow us to achieve higher accuracy.

**Notes**:

> This talk is a more detailed version of the Keynote talk I gave at Velocity NY (which got really good reviews). Rather than just "inspiring" my goal with this talk is to create a community of practitioners that understand the gritty details of applying ML on Source Code.

Prerequisites:

> - Basic understanding of Machine Learning.
> - We'll be talking about Neural Networks including recurrent and LSTM, as well as graph-based Machine Learning, but those concepts will be explained in detail.
