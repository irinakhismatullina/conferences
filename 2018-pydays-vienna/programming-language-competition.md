**Abstract:**

Have you ever been struggling with an nth obscure project, thinking : “I could do the job with this language but why not switching to another one which would be more enjoyable to work with” ? Based on GitHub repositories, it is possible to build a transition matrix by solving the flow optimization problem. The results reflect the history of programming language competition in the open source world.

This project starts with Erik Bernhardsson's blog post : 
<a href="https://erikbern.com/2017/03/15/the-eigenvector-of-why-we-moved-from-language-x-to-language-y.html">The eigenvector of "Why we moved from language X to language Y</a> where the data scientist generated an N*N contingency table of all Google queries related to changing languages. However, what is the proportion of people who effectively switched ? Indeed, it is possible to deepen this idea and see how the popularity of languages changes among GitHub users.

The open dataset used for this project includes the metadata of:
* 4.5 Million GitHub users
* 393 different languages
* 10 TB of source code in total
