**Abstract**:

Machine Learning has revolutionized many fields, from cancer detection to self-driving cars, not forgetting about connected toilets that allow Alexa to flush at your command.

Researchers have been working on applying Machine Learning to source code to predict bugs, find patterns in code, and much more. At source{d}, we're building products applying this research to improve day-to-day developer tasks.

This talk will cover some of the techniques used, mention the most relevant research, but especially concentrate on use cases where Machine Learning can help developers be more efficient.
